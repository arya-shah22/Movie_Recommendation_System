# Movie_Recommendation_System
I developed a Movie Recommendation System using dataset!. By analyzing the correlation between ratings and audience preferences, the system recommends movies users are likely to enjoy.  For example, if you liked Star Wars (1997) or Air Force One (1997), my system suggests other titles you might find equallyÂ appealing.
